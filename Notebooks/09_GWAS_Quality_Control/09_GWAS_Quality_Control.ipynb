    "# GWAS Quality Control using PLINK\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspects of a Genome Wide Analysis Studies (GWAS) is to do thorough Quality control (QC) of the data before analysing it. The QC of GWAS goes through various steps (see figure below), and we will illustrate some of them in this tutorial.\n",

    "## How to make this notebook work\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this notebook we will use both the `command line bash` commands and `R` to setup the file folders.\n",
    "* Having to shift between two languages, you need to choose a kernel every time we shift from one language to another. A kernel contains a programming language and the necessary packages to run the course material. To choose a kernel, go on the menu on the top of the page and select `Kernel --> Change Kernel`, and then select the preferred one. We will shift between two kernels, and along the code in this notebook you will see a picture telling you to change kernel. The two pictures are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/bash.png\" alt=\"Bash\" width=\"80\"> Shift to the `Bash` kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/R.png\" alt=\"R\" width=\"80\"> Shift to the `popgen course` kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can run the code in each cell by clicking on the run cell sign in the toolbar, or simply by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. When the code is done running, a small green check sign will appear on the left side.\n",
    "* You need to run the cells in sequential order to execute the analysis. Please do not run a cell until the one above is done running, and do not skip any cells\n",
    "* The code goes along with textual descriptions to help you understand what happens. Please try not to focus on understanding the code itself in too much detail - but rather try to focus on the explanations and on the output of the commands \n",
    "*   You can create new code cells by pressing `+` in the Menu bar above or by pressing <kbd>B</kbd> after you select a cell. \n",

    "## Identification of duplicated or related individuals\n",
    "To identify duplicated or related individuals we will calculate the identity by descent (IBD) matrix, indicative of relatedness between individuals or repeated samples, that could bias our GWAS. This works best if it is done on a set of non-correlated SNPs. So first we will “prune” the data and create a list of SNPs where no pair (within a given genomic interval) has an r2 value greater than a given threshold, typically chosen to be 0.2.  This can be done by the `indep-pairwise` command, using 500kb as window size and 5 variants as step size:\n"
